# Neighborhood Map

## Description

This is a student project for Udacity's Front-End nanodegree program designed to blablagmate the importance of frameworks to organize code and the power of AJAX calls. This is the first project built entirely by the students from the ground up using specs provided by Udacity. It is a map of a local neighborhood in Edinburgh where the user can select the Point of Interest they would like to know more about. It displays information relative to the point of interest retrieved from the Wikipedia search API.

## Instructions

To run this app and properly retrieve the images from Wikipedia, you will need to set up a simple server. Python makes setting up simple servers really easy. Simply download python3 and run the following command on the root of the repository you wish to start serving: 

```python3 -m http.server```

Then, you can use your localhost on the web to access it.
